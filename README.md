If you are using this Skript script:

- Use /tempban using the Essentials plugin for temporary ban(s).
- You cannot use other plugins for bans, IP bans and kicks. However, if you accidentally banned and IP banned some players with other plugins, unban/unban their IP using the plugin that you used to ban/IP ban them.
- The commands have // in front of them.

Commands:

//ban
//banip
//unban
//kick

//unban bans the player that you wanted to unban (If you used another plugin to ban the player, you can use //unban to unban them.)

There are ban IDs in this Skript.
